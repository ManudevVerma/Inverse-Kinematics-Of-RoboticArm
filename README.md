This is a Project on Inverse Kinematics of 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) planar robotic arm, which refers to the process ofdetermining the joint angles required to position the end effector (the tool or "hand" of the robot) at a desired location and orientation in the workspace.

In simpler terms, it's like figuring out how to move the joints of the robotic arm in order to reach a specific point and angle in space.

For a planar robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom, the arm operates in a 2D plane, so it can move along two axes (usually X and Y) and rotate around one axis (usually Z). Inverse kinematics involves solving mathematical equations that relate the position and orientation of the end effector to the angles of the joints.

It does this by doing various iterations using Cauchy's optimization for multi variable function of theta 1, theta2 and theta3 for the optimizied path that the end effector should follow to reach the target location.
